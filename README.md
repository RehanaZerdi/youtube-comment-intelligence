**YouTube Comment Intelligence System**
This project analyzes YouTube comments to extract meaningful audience insights using unsupervised Natural Language Processing techniques.

## Project Stages

### 1. LLM-Based Exploratory Analysis
In the first stage, a Large Language Model (LLM) is used for exploratory analysis. YouTube comments are processed in batches and hierarchical summaries are generated 
to gain a high-level understanding of audience feedback, common questions, and content requests.

This stage helps in understanding the nature of the data and identifying the need for more structured analysis.
